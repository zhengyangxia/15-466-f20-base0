How To Play:

In this rigged game of pong, the right paddle is controlled by an advanced evil AI. The AI has infected the left paddle with a virus so it moves pseudo randomly. It also rigged the scoreboard so the right paddle starts with a 5:0 lead. Control the ball's direction with your mouse to help the left paddle reach 10 points first and defeat the right paddle!

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
